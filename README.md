x86 MASM 10-Week Condensed College Course CSC-2025 this is the seventh programming assignment

----------

Write a single assembly program that does the following. I recommend doing this in pieces, in the order presented. Building this program incrementally, and making sure each part works, BEFORE moving on to the next part, will save you lots of time in trouble shooting. Be sure to save each version as you go.

Submit your assembly program source code (.asm) file.

  a. Prompt the user to enter a one-line string (maximum of 100 characters) from the keyboard.
  
  b. Accept the one-line string entry on the next line.
  
  c. Next your program should edit the string to remove all of the white spaces, digits, punctuation, and other special characters, leaving only the letters.
  
  d. Finally your program should display the compressed string to the window with appropriate labeling.
  
  e. There should be a repeat option that is not case sensitive.
